    <h1>How to write Research Paper</h1>
    <p>
      Writing a research paper starts with choosing a clear and focused topic.
        You then gather reliable information from books, journals, and online databases.
        A strong thesis statement should guide the direction of your paper.
        Organize your ideas in an outline before writing the first draft.
        Support your arguments with evidence and proper citations.
        Finally, revise, proofread, and format the paper to meet academic standards.
